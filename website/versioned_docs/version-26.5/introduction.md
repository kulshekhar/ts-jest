`ts-jest` is a TypeScript preprocessor with source map support for Jest that lets you use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.

It supports all features of TypeScript including type-checking. [Read more about Babel7 + `preset-typescript` **vs** TypeScript (and `ts-jest`)](babel7-or-ts).

We are not doing semantic versioning and `23.10` is a re-write, run `npm i -D ts-jest@"<23.10.0"` to go back to the previous version
